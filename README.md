# C++ Primer Plus Unofficial Codes

This repository provides unofficial code resources used in C++ Primer Plus (5th edition) by Stephen Prata.

I decided to write them by myself because I was unable to find the official example codes and problem solutions in the publisher's website. And this repository also functions as a C++ learning timeline.

Please NOTE that the solution codes meet and only meet the requirement of the problems. There are no input checking, bounds checking and so on unless explicitly required. And erratas are fixed when writing the code.
